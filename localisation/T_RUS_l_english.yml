    henri_rus_larp.9.d:0 "Since the intitial expansion of the Rus into Muscovy, we have encountered and assimilated many different Chude tribes. The recent conquest of Udmurt, Permian and other Chude lands in the distant forests has been substantially harder to integrate than the previous groups we assimilated. We may have to be more tolerant of their practices and customs."
    henri_rus_larp.9.a:0 "Allow them to practice their customs and traditions, and synergize them with those of the Rus"

We must expand our winter training and train our troops further to maximise on this advantage!"

    henri_rus_larp.13.d:0 "Qasim Moxammat, brother of the Khan of Kazan has arrived in our realm seeking a position of favor. Some have suggested to grant him the Meschyora territory of Kasimov, others suggest merely granting him a position of command."

The nobility of the land are primarily Baltic Germans, deeply hated by the native population but who have many links to Germany and have important skill sets that may be useful. Should we assimilate them or deprive them of their land?"
    henri_rus_larp.15.a:0 "Integrate the German nobility and provide them with prestigous positions"
    henri_rus_larp.15.b:0 "A German can never have a true Russian soul. Confiscate their estates and give them to Orthodox Russians!"

    henri_rus_larp.16.t:0 "Lack of Ports"
    henri_rus_larp.16.d:0 "The critical lack of ports has deeply hurt our trade and import of technology. Until we can open up trade networks to the West, the blockade will hurt us! We have been forced to rely on the strength of our people and boyars in lieu of this chronic situation"
    henri_rus_larp.16.a:0 "The enemies of the Rus will pay, we will not be left in the backwater of history"
