#Missions #LOC MADE BY MARCUS# ###HAHA FUNNY DOG!### #
 
 arl_mystic_order_title: "Mystic Order"
 arl_mystic_order_desc: "The urban sophisticates of Herat and Teheran read their manuscripts and sip their tea with the tip of Timur’s spear at their throats. And yet, they snidely mock us as backward hill people, living in dung and making carpets. Was Safi ad-Din not a great man? Did the angels not come to him and show him the will of the divine? If these men are to believe us to be barbarous, so be it. We shall fall upon them as ravenous wolves and instruct them on what it truly is to bask in the light of the Greatest."
 arl_successors_to_the_aswaran_title: "Successors of the Aswaran"
 arl_successors_to_the_aswaran_desc: "In our heart is the dream of there once again being a great Persian Empire, like those of old. All of Persia’s great empires have had one thing in common; fearsome cavalry. Even the Emperors of faraway Rome would tremble at the thought of the mighty Sassanian Aswaran. So shall they again."
 arl_revenge_for_haydar_title: "Revenge for Haydar"
 arl_revenge_for_haydar_desc: "Once the faithful wept for the passing of Haydar, he and his men cornered and slaughtered by the Shirvanshah. Now only righteous indignation burns in their hearts, that justice is wrought upon the Shirvani dogs that so cruelly beheaded a pious son of Safi. By the grace of God, it shall be done." 
 arl_many_capitals_title: "The Many Capitals"
 arl_many_capitals_desc: "Wise men have always said that Persia is a land of a thousand cities. Of course, some would say these statistics are inflated; however, the point remains true that our lands have many bountiful cities, grand and sprawling. Could it be said that we have only one capital?" 
 arl_cultural_shift_title: "Cultural Shift" 
 arl_cultural_shift_desc: "As we have expanded, so too has the number of different peoples under our rule. Prime among them are the Persians, and many of the administrators employed in our government are Persian. Many at court also prefer to speak Persian over our traditional Azeri tongue. We must decide the place of Persians in our administration." 
 arl_potent_salt_title: "Potent Salt"
 arl_potent_salt_desc: "Over the last decades, the fiery salts of China have become far more of a presence on the battlefield, both here and elsewhere. The Sons of Osman have built their great cannons that crumble a castle’s walls as though God Himself had brought this destruction. Rumors grace our ears that mines of Mianeh have produced the salts needed for wise men to create this salt. It would be a wonderful thing for us to have access to this resource."
 arl_a_new_challenger_approaches_title: "A New Challenger"
 arl_a_new_challenger_approaches_desc: "Many in the past have laughed at us. They said it was impossible for a small order such as ours to spread bountifully across the land, and yet God has willed it so. So let it be said that none dare laugh at us now. The Sons of Timur fight amongst themselves, thinking us not to be the threat that we are. They are fools, and they shall die fools. "
 arl_the_rise_of_the_safavids_title: "Rise of the Safavids"
 arl_the_rise_of_the_safavids_desc: "By the grace of God, we have spread our wings and flown as the eagle does. Soon we will be the masters of all Persia, Lord of the cities of Isfahan, Teheran, Qom, Qazvin, Shiraz, and Tabriz. Of course, with our rise comes important decisions to be made regarding a prime location for our capital."
 arl_spreading_twelver_islam_title: "Spreading Twelver Islam"
 arl_spreading_twelver_islam_desc: "Though our government has secularized somewhat as we have expanded beyond our original borders, our original mission of spreading the true word of God has not and cannot change. We have liberated many of the faithful in Persia, but now our mission must extend further than that. We must make war upon the unbelievers and show them the true light of heaven, even if it is done by the spilling of blood."
 arl_sheep_to_shepherds_title: "Sheep to Shepherds"
 arl_sheep_to_shepherds_desc: "Once, we were a mere footnote on the page of the world. Now, however, our name is known from the docks of Lisbon to the court of China. Our rise has been fast and dramatic, though none can deny that we are the true Masters of Persia and that all those lands which are not already ours soon will be. "
 arl_the_great_shahs_court_title: "The Great Shah's Court" 
 arl_the_great_shahs_court_desc: "Every great ruler requires a splendorous court. And our ruler, let it not go unsaid, is great. Therefore, we shall do as many others have done before and invite the world’s wisest men to serve under our Shah, from mystics to engineers. All will soon see that our Shah is a sophisticate and patron of the arts. " 
 arl_the_zaidist_school_title: "The Zaidist School" 
 arl_the_zaidist_school_desc: "It cannot be said that we agree upon everything with the Zaidis, though our disagreements are comparatively small. There is little doubt in the minds of the faithful that the Zaidis will quickly be brought into the fold and see the righteousness of our Sheikh." 
 arl_the_disgraced_title: "Fallen From Grace"
 arl_the_disgraced_desc: "Mazandaran is one of Persia’s most remote and fertile regions, and long has it been a place resistant to outside invasions. In the proceeding decades, however, under the mismanagement of the Mar’ashis the prosperity of this small slice of fertile land has faded. Perhaps it could once again prosper under our just and righteous rule."
 arl_legacy_of_the_silk_road_title: "Legacy of the Silk Road"
 arl_legacy_of_the_silk_road_desc: "It is true that in recent years, Persia’s economy has fallen on hard times. First, it was the invasion of the Mongols- sacking cities and filling irrigation ditches. Then, once their Empire fell, Timur Gurkani came and ransacked Persia once more. As a result, our once lucrative trade of silk has been dramatically disrupted, fabrics from elsewhere filling the courts of Europe. However, now that we have consolidated our rule over much of Persia, trade and silk production can resume again."

#Events

 FU_Ardabil_Events.1.t: "Shirvanshah"
 FU_Ardabil_Events.1.d: "For many centuries, the rulers of Shirvan have taken the title of Shirvanshah, starting with the Yazidids, given the title by the Abbasid Caliph in the 9th century. The independence of Shirvan has waxed and waned, but the rulers have nonetheless styled themselves as such. We have seized our revenge for the murder of Sheikh Haydar, the city of Baku, and its surrounding lands now ours. The Derbendids have fled north of the Caucusus and pretend to the title of Shirvanshah still, though none can argue that it is not, in truth, ours."
 FU_Ardabil_Events.1.a: "I am the new Shirvanshah!"
 
 FU_Ardabil_Events.2.t: "Persian at Court" 
 FU_Ardabil_Events.2.d: "The use of the Persian language at our court has been increasing steadily as our state has expanded over the Persian heartlands, likewise have the number of Persians employed in our bureaucracy. The core of our oldest and most loyal retainers, however, are Azeri. The tensions between these two groups have increased steadily, and before it reaches a breaking point, we must decide which language- and which culture- is promoted in our government." 
 FU_Ardabil_Events.2.a: "Persian is nice..."
 FU_Ardabil_Events.2.b: "But I prefer Azerbaijani!"
 
 FU_Ardabil_Events.3.t: "Capital of Choice"
 FU_Ardabil_Events.3.d: "All great Persian Empires have had glorious capitals as their crowning jewel. If we are to take on this legacy for ourselves, we must likewise have our capital city be a place of unparalleled glory and beauty. Our dynasty has for centuries now made its home in the mountainous city of Ardabil. Once a mere town, it has grown into a sprawling city and is an excellent candidate to be our capital as we ascend to greatness. "
 FU_Ardabil_Events.3.a: "Our old capital will do just nicely "
 FU_Ardabil_Events.3.b: "Qazvin will be the perfect place for the Shah's court "
 FU_Ardabil_Events.3.c: "Qazvin is the obvious choice, for its trade opportunities "
 
 FU_Ardabil_Events.5.t: "Taking up the Mantle"
 FU_Ardabil_Events.5.d: "The lands north of the Alborz mountains were the last in Persia to fall to Islamic rule, being viciously defended by their Bavandid and Karen rulers. As a result, it is only in the previous century that Muslims have made up the majority of the population, and a sizeable minority of Zoroastrians remain. \n\nThe Mazandaranis last memories of a Persian Empire was that of the House of Sassan, and though they were heathen, we cannot deny their greatness. Indeed it may lend our cause some amount of prestige were we to take on the mantle of the Sassanids, and of course, it would strengthen our support amongst the Zoroastrians of Mazandaran."
 FU_Ardabil_Events.5.a: "Destroy their legacy and create our own"
 FU_Ardabil_Events.5.b: "The Sassanids were a Persian house, let their legacy live through us"
 
 FU_Ardabil_Events.6.t: "Ismail Safavid"
 FU_Ardabil_Events.6.d: "One of our young Princes has begun to show great promise, even though he is but a youth of five. He takes to his lessons well, all of his tutors singing the boy’s praises, and he has even started writing poetry. \n\nIt would not be unreasonable to make young Ismail heir to the throne, given how promising he seems to be compared to other candidates for the position. Such a decision could be controversial, though, to say the least."
 FU_Ardabil_Events.6.a: "He will make a fine heir!"
 FU_Ardabil_Events.6.b: "We will not deny our eldest his birthright!"
