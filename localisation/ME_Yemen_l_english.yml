 #Events

It is not just the leaders of the tribes, even common citizens seem to turn away from us in favor of the opposition. We must find ways to restore our legitimacy and prove the people that we are the chosen ones of Allah to lead Yemen! If there is no other way to prove ourselves, then conquest might be the only solution. Let us end this instability and make the opposing citizens return to our fold!" 
 ME_Yemen_Events.1.a: "Stability! Stability! My Kingdom for some stability!"
 
 ME_Yemen_Events.2.t: "The Marib Dam" 
 ME_Yemen_Events.2.d: "The Sadd Ma'rib was said to be build around 1750 BC to 8th century BC by the ancient kingdom of Saba'. It provided great prosperity to the great nation, making the people's quality of life better. However, the dam was slowly decaying over the centuries, causing for it to crumble and becoming useless. Thousands of the nearby citizens fled from the vicinity to migrate in the north. With the restoration of the dam, it should attract citizens to the vicinity, foreigners even, to aid the growth and prosperity of our country."
 ME_Yemen_Events.2.a: "Let it bring prosperity to our people!"
