 FU_Milan_Events.1.t: "Spinetta Campofregoso of Genoa"
 FU_Milan_Events.1.d: "Son of Spinetta I Fregoso and Benedetta Doria, and grandson of the former Doge Pietro Fregoso, he was born in the Genoese capital in a period around the early 15th Century. Despite the fact that his father exercised the role of podestà of Pera and then later as consul in Caffa, on behalf of the Republic of Genoa, Spinetta Fregoso spent his childhood and part of his adolescence in Genoa. \n\nFollowing the conquest of Genoa by our forces, he was installed as a puppet Doge on the vacant office of the Genoese Republic as a means to prevent future rebellions against Milanese authority." 
 FU_Milan_Events.1.a: "He will make a fine head of state, under our influence."
 
 FU_Milan_Events.2.t: "Academy of Bologna" 
 FU_Milan_Events.2.d: "The date of the University of Bologna's founding is uncertain, but believed by most accounts to have been 1088 and it was granted a charter (Authentica habita) by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa in 1158. \n\nHowever, the development of the institution at Bologna into a university was a gradual process. Paul Grendler writes that “it is not likely that enough instruction and organization existed to merit the term university before the 1150s, and it might not have happened before the 1180s.” \n\nThe university is historically notable for its teaching of canon and civil law; indeed, it was set up in large part with the aim of studying the Digest, a central text in Roman law, which had been rediscovered in Italy in 1070, and the university was central in the development of medieval Roman law. Until modern times, the only degree granted at that university was the doctorate. Bettisia Gozzadini earned a law degree in 1237, being one of the first women in history to obtain a university degree. She taught law from her own home for two years, and in 1239 she taught at the university, becoming the first woman in history to teach at a university. \n\nIn 1477, when Pope Sixtus IV issued a papal bull, authorizing the creation of Uppsala University in Sweden, the bull specified that the new university would have the same freedoms and privileges as the University of Bologna - a highly desirable situation for the Swedish scholars. This included the right of Uppsala to establish the four traditional faculties of theology, law (Canon Law and Roman law), medicine, and philosophy, and to award the bachelor's, master's, licentiate, and doctoral degrees."
 FU_Milan_Events.2.a: "I hear the class of [GetYear] exceeded our expectations!"
 
 FU_Milan_Events.3.t: "Port of Napoli" 
 FU_Milan_Events.3.d: "The foundation of Naples and its port unquestionably dates back to the period of Greek colonisation; in the ninth century B.C. a group of sailors from Rhodes reached this part of the coast and, between the seventh and sixth centuries B.C., the Greek colony was founded on the Acropolis of Pizzofalcone. \n\nIt was under Norman rule that the port enjoyed a period of great splendour becoming the only one of the Italian marine republics to join the famous Lega della Compagnia, known as the “Hanseatic cities”. The period of Norman rule brought Naples and its port a period of successes in maritime affairs and sea traffic. However, it was with the Anjovins in the second half of the thirteenth century, and in particular during the reign of Charles I of Anjou, that the port expanded and it acquired new buildings, while the city became the most heavily populated and admired city in Europe. The fortification of the port and the construction of warehouses, storage depots and factories continued under Aragonese rule (fifteenth century) and under the Spanish viceroy." 
 FU_Milan_Events.3.a: "Let us restore the port of Naples and use it to legitimize further conquest!"
 
 FU_Milan_Events.4.t: "Sforza's Monetary Reforms" 
 FU_Milan_Events.4.d: "Within the duchy of Milan, the Sforza family sought to maintain its newly acquired power by appealing to the people. Francesco (Duke 1450–1466) provided his subjects not only relative peace and patronage of humanism and the arts but also the disadvantages of tyrannical rule. \n\nAlong with these innovations, he ushered in the era of a new taxation system, free of bureaucratic red tape while reducing interest rates for upcoming landowners and newly-formed businesses in the commercial sector."
 FU_Milan_Events.4.a: "Let there be money!"
 
 FU_Milan_Events.5.t: "Palazzo Reale di Milano" 
 FU_Milan_Events.5.d: "The Royal Palace of Milan (Italian: Palazzo Reale di Milano) was the seat of government in the Italian city of Milan for many centuries. It was originally designed to include two courtyards but these were later dismantled to make room for the Duomo. The Palazzo is located to the right of the Duomo's facade, opposite to Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II. The facade of the Palazzo creates a recess in Piazza del Duomo which functions as a courtyard, known as the Piazzetta Reale (literally, a "Small Royal Square"). \n\nThe royal palace has ancient origins. It was first called "Palazzo del Broletto Vecchio", and it was the seat of city's government during the period of medieval communes in the Middle Ages. The palace became a key political center under the Torriani, Visconti and Sforza households. After the construction of the Duomo Cathedral, the Palazzo was heavily renovated thanks to the efforts of Francesco Sforza's government." 
 FU_Milan_Events.5.a: "A palace to match the grandeur of §Y[Root.Monarch.GetName]§!."
 
 FU_Milan_Events.6.t: "A Game of Crowns" 
 FU_Milan_Events.6.d: "Centuries have passed since the commemoration of the last Lormbard King, After a multitude of struggles and political manoeuvring we finally possess the necessary political capital to declare that Lombardy is not only reinstated but also more powerful than ever. Let us go forth and reclaim our long lost splendour and legacy!" 
 FU_Milan_Events.6.a: "Let us reclaim what once was ours!"
 FU_Milan_Events.6.b: "Let us stand firm with the times, instead."
 FU_Milan_Events.6.c: "The way forward is paved of the people - by the people!"
 
 FU_Milan_Events.7.t: "The Milano Ultimatum" 
 FU_Milan_Events.7.d: "News have arrived from the royal court of Milan. The head of state demands we immediately release our provinces on the bordering area of Tirol. According to the official letter the aforementioned lands will be put under Milanese protection as a sign of good faith and cooperation between the Austrian and Milanese crowns." 
 FU_Milan_Events.7.a: "We must accept." 
 FU_Milan_Events.7.b: "The musings of mice do not affect lions."
 
 FU_Milan_Events.8.t: "Pinacoteca e Biblioteca Ambrosiana" 
 FU_Milan_Events.8.d: "The Biblioteca Ambrosiana is a historic library in Milan, Italy, also housing the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana, the Ambrosian art gallery. Named after Ambrose, the patron saint of Milan, it was founded in 1609 by Cardinal Federico Borromeo, whose agents scoured Western Europe and even Greece and Syria for books and manuscripts. Some major acquisitions of complete libraries were the manuscripts of the Benedictine monastery of Bobbio (1606) and the library of the Paduan Vincenzo Pinelli, whose more than 800 manuscripts filled 70 cases when they were sent to Milan and included the famous Iliad, the Ilias Picta. \n\nDuring Cardinal Borromeo's sojourns in Rome, 1585–95 and 1597–1601, he envisioned developing this library in Milan as one open to scholars and that would serve as a bulwark of Catholic scholarship in the service of the Counter-Reformation against the treatises issuing from Protestant presses. To house the cardinal's 15,000 manuscripts and twice that many printed books, construction began in 1603 under designs and direction of Lelio Buzzi and Francesco Maria Richini. When its first reading room, the Sala Fredericiana, opened to the public on 8 December 1609 it was one of the earliest public libraries. One innovation was that its books were housed in cases ranged along the walls, rather than chained to reading tables, the latter a medieval practice seen still today in the Laurentian Library of Florence. A printing press was attached to the library, and a school for instruction in the classical languages." 
 FU_Milan_Events.8.a: "Come one, come all! Culture and knowledge for the masses!"
 
 FU_Milan_Events.10.t: "Milaner Wealth Display"
 FU_Milan_Events.10.d: "Milan's fashion history has evolved greatly throughout the years. Milan began as a centre of fashion in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, as in Venice and Florence, the making of luxury goods was an industry of such importance that in the 16th century the city gave its name to the English word "milaner" or "millaner", meaning fine wares like jewellery, cloth, hats and luxury apparel. By the 19th century, a later variant, "millinery", had come to mean one who made or sold hats. \n\nLater in the early 19th century cheaper silk began to be imported from Asia and the pest phylloxera damaged silk and wine production. More land was subsequently given over to industrialisation. Textile production was followed by metal and mechanical and furniture manufacture. In 1865, the first major department store in the country opened in Milan by the Bocconi brothers (which was called Alle Città d'Italia). This was regarded as a novelty at the time with regards to retailing in Italy. Though, traditionally, artisans would sell the items they made directly or to small stores, the opening of these new department stores modernised the distributions of clothes in the city."
 FU_Milan_Events.10.a: "One is never over-dressed or under-dressed with a little black dress."
 
 FU_Milan_Events.11.t: "The Milano Gazette" 
 FU_Milan_Events.11.d: "Milano was the first gazette published in the city of Milan. The first known number still in existence is dated 28 November 1640, but it is probable that the printing started some months before. As all the newspapers of such time, it derived directly from hand-writing newssheets. It is probable, but it is not verified, that the editor of the Milano was Filippo Velasca who during the 1640s was a compiler of handwritten Avvisi in Milan. \n\nSince 1640 the typographer was surely the Malatesta family who continued to publish it for all the life of the newspaper. The Malatestas were the official printer of the government in Duchy of Milan, having the monopoly of the official publications. They succeeded to pass this privilege for many generations, from Panfolfo (fl. 1594—1626) to Giulio Cesare (fl. 1635—1664), Giovanni Battista (fl. 1635—1654), Marc'Antonio Pandolfo (fl. 1664—1715) who in January 1672 started to print his name in the last page of the newspaper, and finally his nephew, Giuseppe Richini Malatesta (born in 1694 and died in 1793). Due to their privilege of publishing, the Malatestas were like the voice of the Government." 
 FU_Milan_Events.11.a: "Bah! Everyone else is fake news!"
 
 FU_Milan_Events.12.t: "Milano Conservatories and Opera Houses"
 FU_Milan_Events.12.d: "La Scala, an abbreviation in Italian of the official name Teatro alla Scala is an opera house in Milan, Italy. The theatre was inaugurated on 3 August 1778 and was originally known as the Nuovo Regio Ducale Teatro alla Scala (New Royal-Ducal Theatre alla Scala). The premiere performance was Antonio Salieri's Europa riconosciuta. \n\nMost of Italy's greatest operatic artists, and many of the finest singers from around the world, have appeared at La Scala. The theatre is regarded as one of the leading opera and ballet theatres in the world and is home to the La Scala Theatre Chorus, La Scala Theatre Ballet, La Scala Theatre Orchestra, and the Filarmonica della Scala orchestra. The theatre also has an associate school, known as the La Scala Theatre Academy (Italian: Accademia Teatro alla Scala), which offers professional training in music, dance, stage craft and stage management. \n\nDuring Mozart's first tour, his performances were well received, and his compositional talents recognised by commissions to write three operas for Milan's Teatro Regio Ducale, each of which was a critical and popular triumph. He met many of Italy's leading musicians, including the renowned theorist Giovanni Battista Martini, under whom he studied in Bologna.\n\nEvery level of our special §YComposer§! Advisor will also grant §G+0.5 Diplomatic Reputation§!" 
 FU_Milan_Events.12.a: "'The music is not in the notes, but in the silence between.'"
 
 FU_Milan_Events.13.t: "Santa Maria delle Grazie"
 FU_Milan_Events.13.d: "Originally ordered into construction by the famous Duke Ludoviko Sforza, the church was built upon an old gothic chapel and later became the official burial site of the entire Sforza dynasty. Adorned by a beautiful crossing and an exquisite dome, the church was designed by Donato Bramante. \n \nIn 1543, the Titian altarpiece depicting Christ receiving the crown of thorns was installed in the Chapel of the Holy Crown, located on the right of the nave. The painting, looted by French troops in 1797, it would later reside at the Louvre. This chapel is frescoed with Stories of the Passion by Gaudenzio Ferrari. In the small cloister adjacent to the tribune near the door that leads to the sacristy is a fresco by Bramantino. The church also contained frescoes depicting the Resurrection and Passion by Bernardo Zenale." 
 FU_Milan_Events.13.a: "What a magnificent display of faith!"
 
 FU_Milan_Events.14.t: "Santa Maria alla Fontana"
 FU_Milan_Events.14.d: "This beautiful declaration of piety is located just outside the city center and it is traditionally attributed to  Giovanni Antonio Amadeo, serving as both a gathering point for the believers and a sanctuary, a place of great healing. The oldest part is at the back and is made up of the shrine erected in 1507 by the will of the governor, Charles d'Amboise, who believed it to be miraculous and at that time attracted many sick andpilgrims. \nThis older part is characterized by a structure with massive pillars and arches on slender columns. Contrary to what has long been believed, the source of water in the premises of the church had little healing attributes and was merely exceptionally clean for its time, residing in an astonishing naturally-formed spring. A steep staircase connects this evocative original nucleus to the church above, built between 1547-1623." 
 FU_Milan_Events.14.a: "These waters befit royalty!"
 
 FU_Milan_Events.15.t: "Santa Maria Presso San Calso"
 FU_Milan_Events.15.d: "The construction was begun by Gian Giacomo Dolcebuono and Giovanni Battagioin 1493, to house a miraculous icon of the Madonna, initially on the central plan. The first part to be built was the octagonal dome, covered externally by a tambour with a loggia and arcades decorated by twelve brickwork statues by Agostino De Fondulis, designed in Lombard style by Giovanni Antonio Amadeo.\nSome time later, the square portico in classical style was added, perhaps designed by Cesare Cesariano or Cristoforo Lombardo (il Lombardino). The massive eclectic and Mannerist style facade was designed by Galeazzo Alessi in the late 16th century and was realized by Martino Bassi. It is decorated by numerous statues and reliefs by Stoldo Lorenzi and Annibale Fontana. The interior houses numerous works by Milanese Renaissance and Baroque artists: Giovan Battista Crespi (il Cerano), Camillo and Giulio Cesare Procaccini, Carlo Francesco Nuvolone, Antonio Campi, Bergognone, Callisto Piazza and others. \nNotable are the Baptism of Jesus by Gaudenzio Ferrari and Giovan Battista della Cerva, the Fall of St. Paul by Moretto and, on the altar of the right transept, an altarpiece by Paris Bordone. The lectern of the choir is by Giuseppe Meda and on the left transept, within an altar designed by Martino Bassi, is the venerated marble statue of the Assunta by Annibale Fontana with two later angels by Giulio Cesare Procaccini.""
 FU_Milan_Events.15.a: "May our legacy shine for millenia to come!" 
 
 FU_Milan_Events.16.t: "San Fedele a Milano"
 FU_Milan_Events.16.d: "San Fedele is a Jesuit church in Milan, northern Italy. It is entitled to St. Fidelis of Como, patron of the Catholic diocese of Como. \nLocated in Saint Fedele Square in the centre of the city, the church was commissioned by Charles Borromeo from Pellegrino Tibaldi in 1559. The interior is on a single nave, with tall columns in granite. The presbytery was prolonged in the 17th century by Francesco Maria Richino,who also designed the notable sacristy. The facade was completed byPietro Pestagalli from Tibaldi's designs much later. \nIt features a group of Gaetano Matteo Monti's statues representing the Assumption. The interior is decorated with artworks that include a Pieta by Simone Peterzano, a St. Ignatius by Giovanni Battista Crespi (il Cerano) a Transfiguration by Bernardino Campi, and a "Sacred Heart" by Lucio Fontana."
